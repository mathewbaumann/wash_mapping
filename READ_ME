This repo is used for the stage 2 (Lower and Middle Income Countries) estimation of Access to Water and Sanitation Facilities.
Repo Structure
	00_extract: Geo matching and other intial data cleaning steps
		post_extraction.R - handles geo matching of non census surveys
		wash_specific_post_extract.R - script sourced at the end of post_extraction.R which fixes hh_sizes and saves the geo matched data 
		post_extract_IPUMS.R - handles geo matching of IPUMS and other censuses

	01_collapse: Data aggregation and data crosswalking
		collapse.R - handles aggregation as well as household size crosswalking and saves indicator crosswalk ratios
		crosswalk.R - crosswalks indicators based on ratios saved in collapse.R, appends tabulated data sources
		gen_input_file.R - proportions and saves point data
		functions:
			Used in collapse.R
			    initial_cleaning.R - data cleaning steps including variable subsetting, weight fixing, geography data fixing, and finding median interview year for each source
			    hh_cw.R - crosswalks missing household sizes based on ratios of hh sizes in the region
			    functions/address_missing.R - removes data with substantial missingness
			    functions/agg_wash.R - aggregates data 
			    functions/define_wash.R - takes string matched categories and creates binary columns
			    functions/write_cw.R - writes out indicator crosswalk ratios
		    Used in crosswalk.R
		    	cw_indi.R - crosswalks data based on saved ratios from collapse.R
		    	tabulated_data_fix.R - fixes for specific tabulated data sources given to us by our India collaborators

	02_resample: resamples polygon data into points based off of population rasters
		parent.R - launches qsubs to resample data by shapefile
		child.R - script called by parent.R, resamples data by shapefile and writes out new data as points
		append_poly_input_data.R - proportions polygon data and appends it to point data

	03_diagnostics: plots for vetting sources post collaspe
		national_ts.R - plots access across time, comaring to JMP esitamtes
		combined_indicator_ts.R - plots all proportioned indicators per survey across time

	04_strings: matching string responses from surveys to team defined categories
		match_string.R - writes out a csv for water and sanitation with unmatched strings from new sources to be manually matched
		match_strings_IPUMS.R - IPUMS strings handled seperately
